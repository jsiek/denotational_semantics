Could P(N) (or B(A)) be used for semantic subtyping?
And avoid the need for the E and give inversion principles?


V = n | Pf(V) x V

A,B,C,D ::= n | A → B | A ∩ B

[n] = {n}
[A → B] = { (vs,v) | vs ⊆ [A] implies v ∈ [B] }
[A ∩ B] = [A] ∩ [B]

A <: B def= [A] ⊆ [B]


Suppose A → B <: C → D
  { (vs,v) | vs ⊆ [A] implies v ∈ [B] }
  ⊆
  { (vs,v) | vs ⊆ [C] implies v ∈ [D] }

nts C <: A
<=  [C] ⊆ [A]
  Suppose x ∈ [C].
  nts x ∈ [A].
