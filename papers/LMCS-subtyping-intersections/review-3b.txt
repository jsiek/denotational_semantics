Transitivity of Subtyping for Intersection Types

Recommendation: The paper does not meet the high standards set by
Logical Methods in Computer Science, and I recommend rejection.

Overall evaluation: 5


The paper introduces a new presentation of the subtyping relation of
intersection types from the BCD system.

The main property of this <: presentation is the absence of
transitivity property in the definition. As a consequence the system
satisfies the ``subformula conjunction property'' (a weakening of the
subformula property).
A previous presentation by Laurent is mentioned to satisfy the
subformula property but by relying on a sequent-style system.

There is a great improvement with respect to the first version
regarding the introduction. The context and motivations are now much
more clearly presented.

Two main weaknesses remain.

The "subformula conjunction property" is presented in the abstract, as
well as in the introduction. However it is not formally defined in the
technical part, and no proof that <: satisfies it is given. As a new
property, it deserves some discussions. In particular it does not seem
to ensure that types in a derivation of a given A <: B belong to a
finite set of types computable from A and B (as the subformula
property would ensure).

Note that [10] and [29] ensure the traditional (stronger) subformula
property.
Comparison with [10] is extremely short. And comparison with [29]
mostly relies on ``exchanging the six lemmas for just one'' which is
not a very convincing measure. In particular since only two of them
are required in [29] to get the subformula property, and here Theorem
7 relies on Propositions 1, 2, 3, 5 and on Lemma 6. The main advantage
of <: over the presentation of [29] is to avoid the use of sequents,
but instead it relies on six other auxiliary functions and predicates
over types.
